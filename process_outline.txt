Filters & GIS Processes Used

1. Join the park_rec_feature layer to outdoor_rec_poly
    GP Tool: AddJoin

2. Filter boat facilities to only include those owned by HRM.
    GP Tool: Select

3. Merge Joined Rec feature layer with HRM Boat Facilities to get main feature.
    GP Tool: Merge_management

4. Add District, Community, Rural Rec Commuter Area, & Parks reference data to main feature.
    Custom Function: feature_with_reference_data()
    GP Tools: Spatial Join, Join Field (to get population numbers for districts)

5. Add Latitude and Longitude info
    GP Tool: CalculateGeometryAttributes

6. Convert feature class to a Pandas DataFrame

7. Update Column Values (during join operation, some columns were prefixed with the joining table's name)
    This uses python's pandas module
    A. Set Owner field to Owner field or Boat Facility Owner (if exists)
    B. Set Material field to Material field or Outdoor Rec Poly (if exists)
    C. Set AssetID field to Park Rec Feature AssetID
    D. Set Rec Name field to Rec Name or Boat Facility Name (if exists)
    E. Set 'School In Name' field to Yes or No
    F. Calculate Distname_ID field

    Using Custom Functions
        i. Calculate Number of Courts field
        ii. Calculate Subcategory 1 Field
        iii. Calculate Subcategory 2 Field

8. Clean up Attribute Data (Uses python's Pandas module)
    A. Translate Domain values to codes: condition, material, assetstat, owner, etc.
    B. Remove extra fields

9. Filter out Assets
- Uses python's Pandas module
(
    Owner is in ['Halifax', 'Halifax Regional School Board', 'HRSB', 'Halifax Water', 'HW', 'Nova Scotia Power', 'NSPI'] OR
    Asset Name contains the word School
)
    AND
    Subcategory 1 is not null OR Subcategory 2 is not null

10. Export final Table to Excel
